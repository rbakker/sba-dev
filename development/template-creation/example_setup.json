To create an atlas, I (or in the future, you) need to run a
script that takes a configuration file as input.

What follows is a list of items that go into this file.

* ID: 
id of the template, typically taken from the 'defining publication',
first author lastnames and year. In your case: "HNI15",

* delineationSource: "AtlasLabelNiftiFile.nii.gz",
file that contains the atlas labels, currently the nifti format is
supported. Direct import from svg is possible but requires some extra
work.

* metadataSource: "metadatafile"
supported format are ITK-SnAP. Other text-based formats require some
extra work.
The ITK-SnAP format is csv with columns:
- IDX:   Zero-based index
- -R-:   Red color component (0..255)
- -G-:   Green color component (0..255)
- -B-:   Blue color component (0..255)
- -A-:   Label transparency (0.00 .. 1.00) <= IGNORED
- VIS:   Label visibility (0 or 1) <= IGNORED
- IDX:   Label mesh visibility (0 or 1)  <= IGNORED
- LABEL: Label description 
  In LABEL you can also specify abbreviation and hierarchy,
  by using the | separator: label|abbr|parent

* overlays
This is a list of nifti files that contain the available imaging
modalities. For each file, specify
- name: name of the modality, such as "T2", or "nissl"
- source: name of nifti file
- pctile: percentile to use for scaling this data. For example,
    "0.1-99.9" will scale the data between the 0.1% percentile and 99,9% percentile.
    "0-100" scales the data between its min and max value
- descr: description of the data modality, 
    such as "T2*-weighted gradient echo image at 39 Î¼m resolution"

There is also experimental support for high resolution slice stacks.
So for your case, it would be interesting to build both a coronal
and a saggital atlas, with the nissl images in full resolution.
    
* species: animal species
* strain: animal strain (optional)
* nlxName: neurolex name (optional)
* nlxId": neurolex ID (optional
* ncbiName: name in NCBI taxonomy (optional)
* ncbiId: id in NCBI taxonomy (optional)
* hemisphere: hemispheres covered by the parcellation:
  L = left, R = right, LR = both
* definingCitations: list of defining citations,
  each one having
    authors, title, journal, volume, pages, year, doi
